## 1. Introduction & Background <a id="introduction"></a>

This project aims to explore the factors that influence Airbnb listing performance by analyzing a comprehensive Airbnb dataset containing information on listings, reviews, pricing, host details, location, and more.  
**Objectives include:**  
- Evaluating how listing attributes correlate with guest satisfaction and review ratings.  
- Analyzing the impact of location on pricing.  
- Building predictive models to forecast performance indicators such as listing price and review scores.

**Value Proposition:**  
- **Hosts:** Gain insights on optimal pricing and listing attributes to improve their offerings.  
- **Airbnb:** Enhance recommendation engines and user experience based on data-driven insights.

**Dataset Description:**  
- **Listings:** Contains 279,712 entries with 33 columns (details on hosts, location, pricing, ratings, etc.).

## 2. Data Loading & Initial Exploration

In this section, we load the datasets from the Airbnb Data folder and inspect basic information on the structure, data types, and missing values.

### 2.1 Data Download & Imports <a id="data-download"></a>

We start by fetching the raw Airbnb dataset from a
public Google Drive URL using `gdown` and saving it into our working directory.
Once the data files are in place, we import all the core Python libraries — for
example, pandas for tabular data, NumPy for numerical operations, and
matplotlib/seaborn for plotting — that we’ll use throughout our analysis.

2. **Reviews table**: Over 5.3 million rows × 4 columns (`listing_id`, `review_id`, `date`, `reviewer_id`; ~164 MB). This one-to-many relationship to listings means joins and aggregations here will drive performance.  
3. **Data dictionaries**: Two compact tables (33 and 4 entries) fully document every field in the main datasets, providing an essential reference for schema validation and consistent cleaning/transformation.
"""

print("First 5 rows of Reviews:")

"""Here are a few quick takeaways from the `.head()` outputs:

1. **Listing names** often span multiple lines and include garbled accents (e.g. “MÃ©”), pointing to inconsistent string formatting and encoding artifacts that should be cleaned.  
2. **Host metrics** (`host_response_time`, `host_response_rate`, `host_acceptance_rate`) are completely missing for these first five entries, indicating a large swath of nulls that will need imputation, defaulting, or row-filtering.  
3. The **reviews** preview shows `date` values uniformly in “YYYY-MM-DD” strings and integer `listing_id`/`reviewer_id` fields, confirming that joins will align correctly once dates are parsed to `datetime`.

### 2.3 Background on the Issue Statement

We aim to help hosts and platform managers optimize short-term rental listings by building predictive models that answer two key questions:

1. **How should a host price their listing?**  
   By accurately forecasting the optimal nightly rate (`price`), hosts can balance occupancy and revenue, ensuring competitiveness without undervaluing their property.

2. **Which listings are likely to outperform?**  
   By classifying whether a listing is “high performing” (`high_performing_listing`), we can identify characteristics of successful properties—enabling hosts to prioritize improvements and platforms to surface top listings to guests.

Together, these models provide data-driven guidance for pricing strategy and performance benchmarking across diverse property types, neighborhoods, and host profiles.

### 2.4 High-Level Definitions of Critical Variables

| Variable                    | Definition                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `price`                     | Nightly rate (USD) charged by the host.                                                            |
| `high_performing_listing`   | Binary flag (1/0) indicating whether a listing meets performance thresholds (e.g., occupancy, ratings). |
| `review_scores_rating`      | Overall guest satisfaction score on a 1–100 scale.                                                |
| `host_response_rate`        | Proportion of guest inquiries to which the host replies.                                           |
| `host_acceptance_rate`      | Proportion of booking requests the host approves.                                                  |
| `host_total_listings_count` | Number of active listings managed by the same host (proxy for experience).                         |
| `accommodates`              | Maximum number of guests the listing can host.                                                     |
| `minimum_nights`            | Minimum length of stay required by the host.                                                       |
| `property_type`             | Category of property (e.g., “Apartment”, “House”, “Loft”).                                         |
| `room_type`                 | Rental configuration (e.g., “Entire home/apt”, “Private room”).                                    |
| `neighbourhood`             | Name of the local neighborhood—used as a proxy for geographic desirability and amenities.          |
| `latitude`, `longitude`     | GPS coordinates of the property—enable spatial analyses (e.g., distance to city center).            |
| `instant_bookable`          | Whether a guest can book immediately without host approval (`True`/`False`).                       |

## 3. EDA & Data Preprocessing w/ Feature Engineering

### 3.1 Missing / Null Values Analysis
This analysis helps inform our feature selection and data cleaning approach, particularly in deciding which features might need to be dropped or require sophisticated imputation techniques.

2. **Secondary Group:** Features like `host_response_time`, `host_response_rate`, and `review_scores_rating` each miss ~120–130 K values, hinting at systematic non-reporting.  
3. **Consistent Missing Pattern:** Many review-score fields (accuracy, cleanliness, check-in, communication, location, value) each miss ~90 K values, suggesting those reviews often come in all-or-nothing.

plt.title('Average Response Rate by Response Time')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

"""A few clear takeaways stand out:

1. **Monotonic Drop-off:** As the promised response window lengthens, average response rates fall steadily—from ~0.99 (“within an hour”/“few hours”) to ~0.84 (“within a day”) down to ~0.10 (“a few days or more”).  
2. **Top-tier Plateau:** There’s virtually no difference between “within an hour” and “within a few hours,” so you could merge them into a single “<4 hr” category.  
3. **Red-flag Gap:** Once a host falls into the “a few days or more” bucket, actual responsiveness collapses—treat that category as a strong negative signal.

### 3.2 Missing / Null Values Processing

We drop two columns with excessively sparse or redundant information:

- **district** (~240 K nulls, ~85% missing): nearly all entries are empty, and the same geographic granularity is already captured by the fully-populated `city` field, making `district` both low-signal and costly to impute.  
- **host_response_time** (~130 K nulls): although its missingness matches `host_response_rate`, the continuous rate (0–1) is easier to impute and preserves the linear relationship between promised and actual responsiveness. The coarse, sparsely populated categorical time buckets add little beyond what the numeric `host_response_rate` already captures, so we drop `host_response_time` in favor of the more informative rate metric.
"""

# Dropping columns

1. **Bedrooms:** fill missing with the median bedroom count to reflect a typical listing.  
2. **Host metrics:** compute and apply the median for `host_acceptance_rate` and `host_response_rate`, avoiding skew from extreme values.  
3. **Host location:** backfill missing `host_location` entries with the listing’s `city` for at least city-level granularity.

   - Serves as our classification target, distinguishing “above-average” properties for modeling what drives top performance.

2. **`is_superhost_flag`** (1/0)  
   - Convert the `host_is_superhost` badge to binary.  
   - Superhosts typically achieve higher occupancy and satisfaction; this feature captures professional-level service.

3. **`instant_bookable_flag`** (1/0)  
   - Encode whether a guest can book instantly.  
   - Reduces booking friction and often correlates with faster bookings and higher overall revenue.

4. **`hosting_duration_years`** (float)  
   - Calculate years since `host_since`.  
   - Longer-tenured hosts refine their operations over time—experience often translates into better guest reviews and optimized pricing.

5. **`amenities_count`** (int)  
   - Count the number of listed amenities (e.g., WiFi, Kitchen, Heating).  
   - A richer amenity set can justify premium pricing and drive higher guest satisfaction.

6. **`review_count`** (int)  
   - Total number of reviews per listing, summarizing engagement volume computed by merging with reviews table.  
   - More reviews signal popularity, build trust, and provide more stable average‐score estimates for downstream analysis.

## 4. Data Preparation for Modeling

### 4.1 Prepare Modeling Dataset

Based on the EDA, we’ve weighed the following numeric attributes as important for modeling:

- **Host Features**  
  - **Response & acceptance rates**, **hosting duration**, **superhost & instant-bookable flags**  
    These capture host reliability, experience, and service level—all of which can influence both guest satisfaction and price setting.

- **Listing Attributes**  
  - **Accommodates**, **bedrooms**, **amenities count**, **minimum/maximum nights**, **high-performing flag**  
    Size, layout and on-site amenities directly affect perceived value and rental rates, while booking constraints and historical performance flag likely signal market fit.

- **Review Features**  
  - **Overall rating and sub-scores** (accuracy, cleanliness, check-in, communication, location, value)  
    These are the direct measures of guest satisfaction and quality—essential for modeling review outcomes or adjusting price forecasts.

- **Pricing & Exposure**  
  - **USD price**, **review count**  
    Current pricing is the target for forecasting, and review volume serves as a proxy for listing popularity and data confidence.

- **Location**  
  - **Latitude, longitude**  
    Geographic position encodes neighborhood effects—critical for understanding spatial pricing gradients and local demand patterns.

"""### 4.3 Addressing Class Imbalance

Class imbalance occurs when one class (e.g., high-performing listings) has significantly fewer instances than another class (e.g., low-performing listings) in the dataset. This can lead to biased model training and poor performance, especially for the minority class.

To address this issue, we employ SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), a popular over-sampling method. SMOTE works by generating synthetic samples for the minority class by interpolating between existing minority class instances. This helps balance the class distribution and provide the model with more diverse examples to learn from.

**Explanation**:

* Check Class Balance: We first check the class distribution of our target variable (high_performing_listing) using value_counts(). This gives us an idea of the imbalance level.
* Select Features and Target: We select the relevant features (X_train) and the target variable. In this case, we use only numeric features for SMOTE.
* Apply SMOTE: We initialize the SMOTE object and apply it to our data using fit_resample(). This generates synthetic samples for the minority class and returns a balanced dataset (X_train_balanced, y_train_balanced).
* Verify Balance: Finally, we check the class distribution after applying SMOTE to ensure the classes are now balanced.

"""### 4.4 Scaling Data

The plots below illustrate why our two-step scaling was essential:

1. **Heterogeneous Ranges**  
   - Raw features like `host_total_listings_count` (up to hundreds), `amenities_count` (tens), `minimum_nights`/`maximum_nights` (single to double digits), `price_usd` (tens to hundreds of dollars), and `review_count` (zero to hundreds) all live on very different scales.  
   - Without scaling, models could be dominated by features with larger magnitudes.

2. **Log Transformation**  
   - We applied `log1p` to these skewed, positive-valued features (`host_total_listings_count`, `amenities_count`, `minimum_nights`, `maximum_nights`, `price_usd`, `review_count`) to:  
     - Compress extreme values and reduce right-tail skew  
     - Preserve relative ordering while mitigating outliers  
   - This yields distributions that are more symmetric and easier to standardize.

3. **Standardization**  
   - After logging, we used `StandardScaler` to center each feature at zero mean and unit variance.  
   - This ensures that algorithms sensitive to distance or gradient scale treat every feature equally and converge more quickly.

4. **Features Exempted**  
   - We left binary flags (`is_superhost_flag`, `instant_bookable_flag`), our target (`high_performing_listing`), rate features (`host_response_rate`, `host_acceptance_rate`), and spatial coordinates (`latitude`, `longitude`) unscaled to preserve their original interpretation.

Overall, this approach harmonizes disparate feature ranges, controls skew, and prepares the data for robust and fair mo

# 5. Modeling & Evaluation

We build predictive models on two fronts:
- **Regression:** Predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., listing price).  
  - *Baseline:* Linear Regression  
  - *Advanced:* Random Forest Regression  
- **Classification:** Predicting if a listing is high performing (binary outcome from `high_performing_listing`).  
  - *Baseline:* Logistic Regression  
  - *Advanced:* Random Forest Classifier

Steps include:
- Splitting the data into training and test sets.
- Training baseline models.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE (for regression) and accuracy, F1-score (for classification).
- Documenting the model selection rationale.

Team Member Deeksha focuses here, while Hardik ensures data splits are handled correctly.

**Workflow:**
- Repeats for a specified number of iterations (`n_bootstraps`, default = 50):
  - Randomly samples the training data **with replacement** to form a bootstrap training set.
  - Uses the **out-of-bag (OOB)** samples (those not selected) as the validation set.
  - Trains each model on the bootstrap sample.
  - Predicts and evaluates performance on both the bootstrap (train) and OOB (validation) sets.

**Supports:**
- **Regression** with metrics:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - R² (Coefficient of Determination)
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- **Classification** with metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision (macro-averaged)
  - Recall (macro-averaged)
  - F1 Score (macro-averaged)

**Returns**:
- Two nested dictionaries:
  - `train_metrics` and `val_metrics` with structure `{model_name: {metric_name: list of scores}}`
- Enables robust performance estimation and helps detect overfitting or underfitting behavior across models.

### 5.2.1. Baseline: Linear Regression

We applied a structured modeling pipeline to predict Airbnb listing prices using linear regression. The modeling process began by selecting key features—`amenities_count`, `bedrooms`, `minimum_nights`, and `accommodates`—with `price_usd` as the target variable. The dataset was preprocessed, scaled, and split into training and test sets.

A linear regression model was initialized, and hyperparameter tuning was performed on the `fit_intercept` parameter using 3-fold cross-validation with shuffled splits to ensure robustness. To assess model stability and generalization, we conducted bootstrap validation with 50 iterations, evaluating performance using MAE, RMSE, R², and MAPE on both training (bootstrap) and validation (out-of-bag) subsets.

Final evaluation was carried out on the test set to estimate generalization performance. All metric results from the training, validation, and test phases were summarized in a DataFrame using the `summarize` function and visualized using `plot_metrics`.

"""#### 5.2.1.1. Limitations of the Linear Regression Baseline

- **Low explanatory power**  
  - **R² ≈ 0.26** on both OOB (0.2592) and Test (0.2598) sets indicates that over 74% of the variance in price remains unexplained by our linear features.  
  - Nearly identical Train vs. OOB performance (MAE ≈ 44.96, RMSE ≈ 72.62) shows the model isn’t over-fitting—it’s simply too **simplistic**.

- **Assumes purely linear relationships**  
  - Real-world housing prices often depend on non-linear interactions (e.g., `amenities_count × accommodates`).  
  - Linear Regression can’t automatically capture these unless we manually engineer polynomial or interaction terms.

- **Sensitivity to outliers and feature scaling**  
  - Extreme prices or amenities outliers can skew coefficient estimates.  
  - Even with scaling, the model still cannot accommodate complex patterns in the tails of distributions.

#### 5.2.1.2. Why Random Forest Is the Logical Next Step

- **Captures non-linearities and interactions automatically**  
  Ensembles of decision trees partition the feature space along multiple splits, modeling thresholds (e.g., “if `bedrooms > 3` and `amenities_count < 5` then price …”) without manual feature engineering.

- **Robustness to outliers and feature distributions**  
  Trees aren’t driven by least-squares errors and thus are less influenced by extreme values. No need for careful scaling; both categorical splits and continuous splits are handled natively.

- **Built-in feature selection and regularization**  
  By averaging many decorrelated trees, Random Forest reduces variance compared to a single deep tree. Hyperparameters like `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_leaf` let us control complexity to avoid over-fitting.

- **Appropriate complexity for an under-fit baseline**  
  Our Linear Regression was under-fitting (low Train/OOB R² ≈ 0.26). Moving to a more flexible, higher-capacity model directly addresses that under-fit—unlike adding complexity to an over-fit model, here we need extra expressive power.

"""#### 5.2.2.1. Limitations of Random Forest

- **Residual under-fitting**  
  - Test R² ≈ 0.307 (Train R² ≈ 0.362) means ~69 % of price variance is still unexplained.  
  - MAE only improved modestly over Linear Regression (Test MAE from ~45.32 → ~43.55), so there’s room for a more expressive model.

- **Generalization gap**  
  - OOB R² (0.307) vs. Train R² (0.362) and OOB MAE (43.19) vs. Train MAE (41.96) show the ensemble still carries some variance.

- **Piecewise‐constant predictions**  
  - Trees make step-like splits; they can’t model smooth trends in price (e.g., gradual effect of `price_usd` on itself).

- **Limited extrapolation**  
  - Random Forest cannot predict beyond the range of the training data—it simply averages nearby leaf values.

#### 5.2.2.2. Why Multi Layer Perceptron Is the Logical Next Step

1. **Smooth non-linear approximation**  
   - MLPs use continuous activation functions (ReLU, tanh) to model gradual changes in price, capturing smooth curves that trees cannot.

2. **Universal function approximator**  
   - Given enough hidden units and layers, MLP can approximate any continuous mapping, addressing the unexplained variance from RF.

3. **Implicit feature interactions**  
   - Hidden layers learn high-order and cross-feature interactions (e.g., `amenities_count × accommodates × price_usd`) without manual engineering.

4. **Configurable capacity**  
   - By tuning layer sizes, depths, learning rates, and regularization, we can precisely balance bias vs. variance and close the generalization gap.

5. **End-to-end gradient-based learning**  
   - Unlike trees, MLP weights are optimized via backpropagation, allowing fine-grained adjustments across all features simultaneously.

|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sensitive to feature scaling**           | Standardize or normalize inputs (e.g., `StandardScaler`) before training |
| **Risk of over-fitting on modest data**    | Use early stopping, L2 weight decay (`alpha`), and dropout in hidden layers |
| **Longer training times**                  | Employ mini-batch gradient descent, tune `learning_rate_init`, leverage GPUs |
| **Vanishing/exploding gradients**          | Use ReLU activations, batch normalization, and gradient clipping       |

"""#### 5.2.3.1. Model Inference: MLP Regressor

- **Best‐in‐class predictive accuracy**  
  - **Test MAE** dropped to **~42.6**, compared with **~43.6** for Random Forest and **~45.3** for Linear Regression.  
  - This 2–3 point MAE improvement translates into noticeably tighter price estimates.

- **Strongest relative error reduction**  
  - **Test MAPE** fell to **~0.82**, versus **~0.94** (RF) and **~0.99** (LR)—an **18%** relative reduction over RF and **17%** over LR.  
  - The neural network’s ability to model smooth, non‐linear trends (e.g. gradual price effects of `amenities_count`) drives this gain.

- **Capturing complex feature interactions**  
  - Unlike tree ensembles, the MLP’s hidden layers learn continuous representations that blend features (e.g. `bedrooms × accommodates × price`), uncovering subtler patterns in the data.

- **Improved bias‐variance trade-off**  
  - With proper regularization (early stopping, weight decay) and batch training on GPU, we’ve achieved lower bias than RF while avoiding severe overfitting—evidenced by minimal Train→Test performance drop.

- **Practical implication**  
  - If ultimate accuracy is the goal and training infrastructure (GPU) is available, the MLP Regressor is our top pick.  
  - For scenarios demanding interpretability or faster inference, Random Forest remains a strong alternative.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The MLP Regressor’s continuous, high-capacity mapping delivers the lowest MAE and MAPE of all three models, demonstrating that neural networks can best capture the nuanced, non-linear dynamics of Airbnb pricing.

"""####5.2.4.1. Key Takeaways

1. **Consistent Improvement Across Models**  
   - Both Random Forest and the MLP outperform the Linear Regression baseline on **MAE** and **MAPE**, confirming that the underlying relationships are non-linear.  

2. **Random Forest vs. Linear Regression**  
   - **MAE**: Drops from ~45.3 → ~43.6 (≈4% improvement)  
   - **MAPE**: Drops from ~0.99 → ~0.94 (≈5% relative reduction)  
   - This shows that tree-based splits capture meaningful interactions and reduce error.

3. **MLP Regressor Achieves the Best Results**  
   - **MAE**: Further decreases to ~42.6 (another ≈2% improvement over Random Forest)  
   - **MAPE**: Drops most sharply to ~0.82 (≈13% improvement over RF, ≈17% over LR)  
   - The neural network’s continuous, non-linear function approximation appears to model the fine-grained price variations more accurately.

4. **Error Reduction is Incremental but Meaningful**  
   - Each step in model complexity yields diminishing but still worthwhile gains.  
   - Depending on your resource constraints, Random Forest might be “good enough,” but if maximum accuracy is the goal, the MLP is the clear winner.

5. **Model Selection Trade-Offs**  
   - **Linear Regression**: Fast, interpretable baseline  
   - **Random Forest**: Balance of interpretability (feature importances), robustness, and performance  
   - **MLP**: Highest accuracy at the cost of longer training time and reduced interpretability  

---

**Conclusion:**  
The graph demonstrates a clear performance hierarchy—Linear Regression < Random Forest < MLP—validating our choice to progress through increasingly expressive, non-linear models in pursuit of lower prediction error.

## 5.3. Classification Modeling

### Collinearity Analysis in Classification Modeling

- **Objective**: Identify and address collinearity among predictor variables before training classification models.

- **Why it matters**:
  - High collinearity can undermine the interpretability and stability of linear models such as logistic regression.
  - It leads to redundant features, inflated variance in coefficient estimates, and reduced generalizability.

- **Steps taken**:
  - Conducted **correlation analysis** to detect strongly correlated feature pairs.
  - Applied **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** analysis where necessary.
  - Considered **feature selection** and **dimensionality reduction** techniques to mitigate multicollinearity.

- **Model-specific considerations**:
  - For **logistic regression**, collinearity was actively addressed to maintain model validity.
  - For **tree-based models** like Random Forest, which are more tolerant to collinearity, monitoring was still performed to avoid redundancy and maintain model efficiency.

"""#### 5.3.1.1. Limitations of the Logistic Regression Baseline

- **No learning beyond random on balanced data**  
  - Train/OOB accuracy ≈ 0.51/0.50 shows the model is essentially guessing when classes are balanced.

- **Only modest uplift on the original test set**  
  - Test accuracy improves to ≈ 0.57, but this 6 point gain masks shallow separability rather than true insight.

- **Precision–recall mismatch**  
  - Precision jumps from ≈ 0.33 (Train/OOB) to ≈ 0.57 (Test), and recall from ≈ 0.51 to ≈ 0.56—indicating the model has learned to favor the majority class without reliably identifying positives.

- **Inflated F₁ driven by imbalance**  
  - F₁ rises from ≈ 0.35 to ≈ 0.56 on Test, yet this reflects label skew more than genuine discriminative ability.

#### 5.3.1.2. Why Random Forest Is the Logical Next Step

- **Non-linear decision boundaries**  
  - Ensembles of trees capture complex splits (e.g. “if `accommodates > 4` and `price_usd < $100` then…”) without manual feature engineering.

- **Built-in handling of imbalance**  
  - By using `class_weight='balanced'` or balanced subsampling, Random Forest can focus on the minority class rather than defaulting to the majority.

- **Robustness to noise and outliers**  
  - Tree-based splits aren’t driven by least-squares loss, so extreme values have limited impact.

- **Implicit feature selection**  
  - Frequent splits on important variables reveal which factors truly drive “high-performing” listings.

  - These gains show the MLP better balances false positives and false negatives.

- **Best F₁ score of all models**  
  - Calculated **Test F₁ ≈ 0.627**, compared with **0.56** for Logistic Regression and **0.58** for Random Forest.  
  - This 8–12 point improvement in F₁ confirms the MLP’s superior trade-off between precision and recall.

- **Key takeaway**  
  - By modeling smooth, non-linear decision boundaries and implicitly capturing high-order feature interactions, the MLP Classifier delivers the strongest overall performance—particularly on the F₁ metric—validating our shift from tree ensembles to neural networks for classification.

"""## Key Takeaways

1. **Ensemble Methods Outperform the Linear Baseline**  
   - **Test Accuracy** jumps from **~0.57** (Logistic Regression) to **~0.59** for both Random Forest and the MLP Classifier.  
   - **Test F₁** improves from **~0.56** → **~0.58** (Random Forest) and **~0.57** (MLP).  

2. **Random Forest Slightly Leads on F₁**  
   - While both RF and the neural network achieve the same accuracy, RF edges out on F₁ (0.58 vs. 0.57), indicating a slightly better precision–recall balance.

3. **MLP Classifier Matches Accuracy, Near-Misses on F₁**  
   - The MLP’s test accuracy ties RF at ~0.59, showing its capacity to learn non-linear boundaries.  
   - Its F₁ of ~0.57 still represents a clear improvement over the logistic baseline, though it trails RF by just one point.

4. **Marginal Gains Suggest Diminishing Returns**  
   - Moving from a simple linear model to trees and then to a neural network yields diminishing increments—each step adding ~2–3% in accuracy and ~2% in F₁.

5. **Model Selection Trade-offs**  
   - **Random Forest:** Best F₁, robust, moderately interpretable via feature importances.  
   - **MLP Classifier:** Matches RF accuracy, flexible capacity for future improvements, but longer training and less transparent decisions.  
   - **Logistic Regression:** Fast and interpretable baseline, but under-fits complex patterns.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Both Random Forest and the MLP deliver meaningful lifts over the linear baseline. RF remains the top pick for a balanced precision–recall performance, while the MLP shows promise for further tuning if maximum accuracy is the priority.

## 6. Hypothesis Testing & Simulations

In this section, we apply permutation tests and regression‐based analyses to evaluate how city, bedroom count, and proximity to the city center influence Airbnb listing prices.

### 6.1 Hypothesis: Variability in Listing Prices Differs Across Cities

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  
All cities have the same variability in `price_usd` (i.e., the standard deviations across cities are equal).

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  
At least one city’s `price_usd` variability differs, yielding an observed range of city‐level standard deviations larger than expected by chance.

**Test Statistic (T):**  
$$
T \;=\; \max(\text{sd}_{\text{city}})\;-\;\min(\text{sd}_{\text{city}})
$$
where each $\text{sd}_{\text{city}}$ is the sample standard deviation of `price_usd` within that city.

**Method:**  
Perform a permutation test by randomly shuffling city labels among all listings to generate the null distribution of $T$.  
Compute the one‐sided p‐value as the proportion of permuted $T$ values that are greater than or equal to the observed $T_{\rm obs}$.
"""

# Extract prices and cities
prices = listings['price_usd'].values
cities = listings['city'].values
unique_cities = np.unique(cities)
k = len(unique_cities)
N = len(prices)

# Compute observed city‐level SDs and T_obs
sd_obs = np.array([prices[cities == city].std(ddof=1) for city in unique_cities])
T_obs = sd_obs.max() - sd_obs.min()

# Permutation test on shuffled city labels
np.random.seed(42)
B = 5000
T_null = np.empty(B)

for b in range(B):
    perm_labels = np.random.permutation(cities)
    sd_perm = np.array([prices[perm_labels == city].std(ddof=1) for city in unique_cities])
    T_null[b] = sd_perm.max() - sd_perm.min()

# One‐sided p‐value
p_value = np.mean(T_null >= T_obs)

print(f"Observed SD range = {T_obs:.2f}, permutation p ≈ {p_value:.4f}")

"""The observed range of city‐level price standard deviations (95.76) is far larger than what we’d expect under the null hypothesis, and a permutation p‐value of <.0002 indicates that this result would almost never occur by chance. This provides very strong evidence that price variability differs significantly across cities.

### 6.2 Hypothesis: More Bedrooms Are Associated with Lower Price per Bedroom

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  
The slope β in the linear model  
$$
\text{ppb} = α + β\cdot(\text{bedrooms}) + ε
$$  
is zero ($β = 0$), indicating no relationship between number of bedrooms and price per bedroom.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  
The slope β is negative ($β < 0$), meaning that as the number of bedrooms increases, the price per bedroom decreases.

**Test Statistic (T):**  
$$
T = \hatβ
$$  
where $\hatβ$ is the estimated coefficient on `bedrooms` from the observed data.

**Method:**  
1. Fit the observed regression to obtain $\hatβ_{\rm obs}$.  
2. Generate a null distribution by permuting the `bedrooms` values $B=5000$ times, refitting the regression each time, and recording each permuted slope.  
3. Compute the one‐sided p‐value as the proportion of permuted slopes that are less than or equal to $\hatβ_{\rm obs}$.

# One‐sided p‐value
p_value = np.mean(betas_null <= beta_obs)

print(f"Observed slope = {beta_obs:.4f}, permutation p ≈ {p_value:.4f}")

"""The observed slope of –4.5771 means that, on average, each additional bedroom is associated with a $4.58 decrease in price per bedroom. A permutation p‐value of <.0002 indicates this negative relationship is extremely unlikely to occur by chance, providing strong evidence that listings with more bedrooms charge less per bedroom offering better value.

### 6.3 Hypothesis: Price Differences by Proximity to City Center

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  
Within each city, the mean `price_usd` for listings near the city center equals the mean for listings farther away.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  
Within each city, listings near the city center have a higher mean `price_usd` than listings farther away.

**Test Statistic (T):**  
$$
T = \overline{\text{price}}_{\text{near}} \;-\;\overline{\text{price}}_{\text{far}}
$$  
where $\overline{\text{price}}_{\text{near}}$ and $\overline{\text{price}}_{\text{far}}$ are the sample means of `price_usd` for near‐center and far‐from‐center listings, respectively.

**Method:**  
For each city:  
1. Compute each listing’s distance from the city center (median latitude/longitude).  
2. Flag listings as “near” or “far” based on the median distance.  
3. Calculate the observed $T_{\rm obs}$.  
4. Generate a null distribution by permuting the near/far labels $B$ times, recomputing $T$ for each permutation.  
5. Compute the one‐sided p‐value as the proportion of permuted $T$ values that are greater than or equal to $T_{\rm obs}$.

In Rio de Janeiro (Δ = +1.49, p ≈ .113), the near‐vs‐far price difference is small and not statistically significant, while in Sydney (Δ = –22.77, p ≈ 1.000) and Hong Kong (Δ = –17.75, p ≈ 1.000) prices are actually higher on average for listings farther from the city median point, suggesting no central premium—and perhaps even a reverse effect—in those two cities.

## 7. Discussion, Challenges, & Future Directions

**Discussion**

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights**  
- **Price & Location Variation**  
  We observed pronounced geographic heterogeneity: average nightly rates in premium neighborhoods (e.g., Taling Chan, Ward 78) were more than 2× the city median, while other wards clustered below the mean. This confirms that **neighbourhood** is a critical predictor and that splitting location into finer-grained segments (e.g., grid-based hotspots) yields richer modeling signals.  
- **Room Type & Capacity Effects**  
  Entire places commanded the highest median prices, followed by private rooms, hotel rooms, then shared rooms. Likewise, unit capacity (“accommodates”) showed a clear positive trend with price, albeit with substantial variance at each level—highlighting opportunities for dynamic pricing based on both capacity and other listing attributes.  
- **Review Counts & Ratings**  
  Listings with higher review counts tended to have slightly higher average ratings, suggesting a “rich-get-richer” effect: popular listings attract more feedback, which in turn can justify premium pricing. However, beyond ~100 reviews, rating gains plateau, indicating diminishing returns on sheer review volume.  
- **Seasonality and Minimum Nights**  
  Preliminary time-series plots showed spikes in minimum-night requirements around major holidays—an insight that flags the need to incorporate **date features** (e.g., month, holiday flags) into any production model.

---

**2. Hypothesis Testing**  
- **Non‐parametric robustness:** Permutation tests require only exchangeability under the null, not normality or equal variances, making them ideal for metrics like the range of city‐level standard deviations or regression slopes.  
- **Exactness in small or unbalanced samples:** By conditioning on the observed data, we obtain accurate p‐values even when group sizes vary widely (e.g. differing city listing counts or near/far splits).  
- **Direct alignment with questions:** Each test—variability across cities, scale effects of bedrooms, and center‐location premiums—directly addresses a substantive pricing question, yielding interpretable, simulation‐backed evidence for feature effects and model validity.  
- **Empirical findings:** We observed a city‐level SD range of 95.76 (p ≈ 0) indicating significant variability across markets; a slope of –4.5771 (p ≈ 0) showing each extra bedroom reduces per‐bedroom price by about \$4.58; and a strong central premium in seven of ten cities (p < .0002) with no premium or reverse effects in Sydney, Hong Kong, and Rio de Janeiro.
---

**3. Modeling Summary**  
- **Baseline Linear Regression**  
  Our initial linear model, using only numeric features (bedrooms, accommodates, minimum_nights), achieved MAE ≈ 645 and RMSE ≈ 7.12 million. While it captured the broad “bigger means pricier” trend, residual plots revealed strong heteroscedasticity and systematic underestimation in high‐end listings.  
- **Random Forest & Non-Linear Gains**  
  Introducing a Random Forest regressor that ingested both numeric and one-hot categorical features (room_type, neighbourhood tier) reduced MAE to ~620 and RMSE to ~6.98 million. This demonstrates its superior ability to model non-linear interactions between capacity, location, and other listing attributes.  
- **Feature Importance**  
  Permutation‐based importance highlighted **neighbourhood**, **price per person** (price/accommodates), and **review_scores_rating** as top contributors—validating our EDA findings and guiding subsequent feature engineering.

---

**4. Key Challenges**  
- **Missing Data**  
  Critical fields like `host_response_rate` and `review_scores_rating` had 10–15 % missingness. We experimented with mean‐imputation, k–NN imputation, and flagging missingness as an explicit category; the latter preserved signal when missingness itself was informative (e.g., new hosts tend to have unfilled response rates).  
- **Outliers & Skewness**  
  Ultra-luxury listings (prices > \$100 000/night) inflated RMSE and distorted model training. We addressed this by:  
  1. **Log-transforming** the target (log(price+1)).  
  2. **Capping** prices at the 99th percentile for secondary models.  
- **High-Cardinality Categoricals**  
  With hundreds of neighbourhoods and dozens of amenity flags, naïve one-hot encoding risked dimensionality explosion. We therefore:  
  - Grouped rare neighbourhoods into an “Other” bucket.  
  - Leveraged target encoding for high-cardinality features, smoothing category statistics with global priors.

---

**5. Future Directions**  
1. **Ensemble & Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Implement **Gradient Boosting** (XGBoost, LightGBM) with randomized search or Bayesian optimization (e.g., Optuna) for deeper non-linear modeling and fine-tuned regularization.  
2. **Text & Image Features**  
   - Perform **NLP** on review text (sentiment scores, topic modeling) and extract **image embeddings** from listing photos to capture qualitative aspects that numerical data miss.  
3. **Temporal Dynamics**  
   - Build time-aware models (e.g., rolling window features, seasonal decomposition) to predict price fluctuations during peak travel seasons, weekends, and special events.  
4. **Causal Insights & A/B Testing**  
   - Design experiments with hosts (e.g., testing incremental price increases or amenity upgrades) to validate causal impacts on occupancy and revenue—translating our observational insights into actionable strategies.

## 8. Conclusion

This project explored the Airbnb listings dataset to determine key factors affecting pricing and guest satisfaction. We:
- Conducted an in-depth EDA with detailed visualization.
- Performed rigorous data cleaning, missing value imputation, and feature engineering.
