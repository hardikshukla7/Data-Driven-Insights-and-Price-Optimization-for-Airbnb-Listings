# Data-Driven Insights and Price Optimization for Airbnb Listings

---

## üìä Overview

This project presents an end-to-end data science pipeline analyzing over 270,000 Airbnb listings across major global cities. The objective is to uncover key pricing drivers and guest satisfaction factors through comprehensive data processing, feature engineering, geospatial analysis, and predictive modeling.

## üîç Key Features

* **Data Acquisition & Cleaning**: Collected and cleaned extensive Airbnb datasets, addressing missing values and inconsistencies to ensure data integrity.

* **Feature Engineering**: Extracted and transformed relevant features, including geospatial coordinates, room types, and host attributes, to enhance model performance.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted in-depth EDA to identify trends, correlations, and anomalies within the data.

* **Predictive Modeling**:

  * Implemented regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, PyTorch-based MLPs) to predict listing prices.
  * Developed classification models to assess listing performance categories.
  * Achieved a 6% reduction in price prediction error and improved F1 scores for performance classification.

* **Statistical Analysis**:

  * Applied permutation tests and bootstrapped validation to assess the significance of various features.
  * Utilized SMOTE for class balancing in classification tasks.

* **Insights & Recommendations**: Derived actionable insights for hosts, such as optimal pricing strategies based on location and property features.
